//  1. Shorthand for Initializing Properties;
//  prior to ES6, we had to manually define the names of the properties during initialization. But in ES6, if the property name is same, we donâ€™t need to initialize it.
const Laptop = (manufacturer,model, year)=> {
    return [manufacturer,model,year]
};
console.log(Laptop("intel", "core-i3", 1998));

// 2.Shorthand for writing Methods:
// prior to ES6 we had to write extra codes to write a simple function. But now we can use functions in normal ways
const getLaptop=(manufacturer,model, year)=>{
    return {
        saymodel (){
            return model;
        }
    }
}

// 3.Computed Properties and Object Literals
// In ES6 we can compute the property and object literal. For example, here we are assigning the openinghours object property dynamically.
const weekdays = ['sat','sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri'];
const openingHours = {
    [weekdays[3]] : 12,
    [weekdays[2]] : 14,
    [weekdays[1]] : 10,
}
console.log(openingHours);  // output: { tue: 12, mon: 14, sun: 10 }
